### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 a favorite of mine because I was first getting introduced
    to this class. This was the first time I had to put my skills
    to use in C++, as I had to do such things as define the main
    function, use std::cout and use return. All of this resulted
    in a text that greeted us, it was veryfun coding with me and
    my first group.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 is one of my favorites because I got to code
    something that defines a set of functions to convert a volume
    from milliliters (mL) into various common kitchen measurement
    units such as teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. I always
    wondered how you can convert something like this in a code, and
    this showed me how easy it was. My favorite part was trying to find
    the right numbers for the conversions in the division, it was like a
    maze.


* Lab 10

    Lab 10 my 2nd most favorite because this code processes a
    list of counties and their populations. It combines all
    county names into a single string, retrieves the population
    of a specific county, and calculates the total population
    of all counties. In addition, it did all this in only 1 part.
    It surprised me we could do so much with so little.
